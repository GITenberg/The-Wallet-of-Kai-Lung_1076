description: "The Wallet of Kai Lung is a collection of fantasy stories by Ernest\
  \ Bramah, all but the last of which feature Kai Lung, an itinerant story-teller\
  \ of ancient China. It was first published in hardcover in London by Grant Richards\
  \ in 1900, and there have been numerous editions since. Its initial tale, \"The\
  \ Transmutation of Ling\", was also issued by the same publisher as a separate chapbook\
  \ in 1911. The collection's importance in the history of fantasy literature was\
  \ recognized by the anthologization of two of its tales in the celebrated Ballantine\
  \ Adult Fantasy Series, edited by Lin Carter and published by Ballantine Books;\
  \ \"The Vision of Yin\" in Discoveries in Fantasy (March, 1972), and \"The Transmutation\
  \ of Ling\" in Great Short Novels of Adult Fantasy Volume II (March, 1973).\nAlthough\
  \ the collection is presented in the fashion of a novel, with each of its component\
  \ stories designated chapters, there is no overall plot aside from each of the first\
  \ eight tales being presented as narratives told by Kai Lung at various points in\
  \ his itinerant career. The final tale is represented as being from a manuscript\
  \ left by its own separate first-person narrator, Kin Yen.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
